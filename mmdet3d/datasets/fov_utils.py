"""Camera field-of-view tests for the NAVSIM front-camera rig.

NAVSIM ships a 360-degree merged point cloud, but an agent built on the three
front cameras (``CAM_F0`` / ``CAM_L0`` / ``CAM_R0``) only ever observes a wedge
of roughly +-87 degrees.  The rectangular front-only ``bev_roi`` therefore
still admits objects that no camera in the rig has seen, which a
camera-conditioned teacher cannot learn and should not be scored on.

Visibility is decided by **projection**, mirroring BEVFormer's
``point_sampling``: push the point through the full ``lidar -> image`` matrix,
require positive depth, and require the pixel to land inside the image.  A
fixed azimuth threshold is not equivalent -- the cameras sit off the LiDAR
origin, so the observed region is not a clean wedge from the ego frame. On a
fixed 150-frame navtrain sample, projection drops 5.2% of the boxes inside the
front-only ROI where an equivalent +-87 degree wedge drops only 1.6%.

The test is deliberately run on the **raw sensor geometry**, before
``ImageAug3D`` / ``GlobalRotScaleTrans``.  Those augmentations rotate the LiDAR
frame virtually and the model undoes them via ``lidar_aug_matrix`` when it
projects, so an object's visibility is a property of its original position, not
of the sampled augmentation.  Keeping the test pre-augmentation also makes the
label set deterministic across epochs.
